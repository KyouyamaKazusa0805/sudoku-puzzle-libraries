# Sudoku Puzzle Libraries

This repository stores some sudoku puzzle libraries that I will or may use.

## Project Structure

All puzzle libraries will be separated by two parts:

* Raw file part
* JSON file part

The full information of a valid puzzle library will be merged by folder "libararies". All JSON file names will match the library names.

## Copyright

Some of puzzle libraries are not created and calculated by me, they will be displayed in JSON files. All rights are reserved by their own owners, rather than me.
