# Sudoku Puzzle Libraries

This repository stores some sudoku puzzle libraries that I will or may use.

## Project Structure

All puzzle libraries will be separated by two parts:

* Raw file part
* JSON file part

The full information of a valid puzzle library will be merged by folders "info" and "libararies". All JSON file names will match the library names.

## Copyright

Some of puzzle libraries are not created and calculated by me, so they will be displayed in JSON files stored in folder "info". All rights are reserved by their own owners, rather than me.
